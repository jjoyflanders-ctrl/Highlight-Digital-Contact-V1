# Employee photos (replace the right-side image)

## Add a photo per employee
1) Upload photos to: assets/people/
2) Add a `photo` column to employees.csv
3) Put the file path in that column, e.g.:
   assets/people/kayden-johnson.jpg

If `photo` is blank, the default image is used: assets/right-panel.png
